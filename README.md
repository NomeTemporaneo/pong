# Pong

Pong is a great game, really.

## Getting Started

This is a basic project to test [Phaser], a framework which helps creating HTML5 games, and a starter, to get busy and going.
It's in full development (see TODO list to check its status).

### TODO list:

Next patch:

- Create a bar and moving them.
- Abolish the wall behind the bar.
- Make the ball bounce against the bar.

Future patches:

- How to create the AI of the enemy?

### Prerequisites

You need node.js and npm configured and installed.

### Installing

Install [live-server] globally ( npm install -g live-server ) and just type "live-server" and you will get the dev env in localhost.

## Built With

- [Phaser](https://phaser.io) - The web framework used
- Assets from phaser.io (this is still a "test" game)

## Contributing

Be part of our community! I can't understand why I am saying all of these in english since we're an italian community.
