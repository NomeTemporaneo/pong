# Pong

Pong is a great game, really.

## Getting Started

This is a basic project to test [Phaser], a framework which helps creating HTML5 games, and a starter, to get busy and going.
It's in full development (see TODO list to check its status).

### TODO list:

Next patch:

- Abolish the horizontal walls.
- Ball respawn
- Score

Future patches:

- Design HUD
- How to create the AI of the enemy?
- Create a Title screen
- Multiplayer mode

### Prerequisites

You need node.js and npm configured and installed.

### Installing

Install live-server globally ( npm install -g live-server ) and just type "live-server" and you will get the dev env in localhost.

## Built With

- [Phaser](https://phaser.io) - The web framework used
- Assets from phaser.io (this is still a "test" game)

## Contributing

Be part of our community! I can't understand why I am saying all of these in english since we're an italian community.
